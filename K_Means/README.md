# K-Means
*last updated: 29-Aug-2019*

K Means is a very popular algorithm.  In fact it is one of the most popular algorithms for working with unlabeled data. Why?

Many of the recent advances people have been excited about in Machine Learning (ML) actually have come from domains with labeled data sets rather then unlabeled datasets (ie - a bunch of pictures with the labels saying what they are (*cat*, *alpaca*, *didjeridu*)).  The problem is then simply to fit a model - truthfully often a very complex and non-linear model - which can map the features of the data to this set labels.  What if we don't ?  

It is actually a simplified version of another algorithm known as Gaussian Mixture Modeling.  I have another notebook devoted to this algorithm, so if that is of interest to you, I suggest you check that out after this.  Regardless K-Means is a great place to start, because if you can understand this version you are in great shape to understand a more complex version down the line.
