# K-Means
*last updated: 29-Aug-2019*

### Intro and Motivation

K Means is a very popular algorithm.  In fact it is one of the most popular algorithms for working with unlabeled data. Why?

Many of the recent exciting advances in Machine Learning (ML) actually have come from problems with labeled data (ie - a bunch of pictures with the labels like *cat*, *alpaca*, *didjeridu*).  The modeling problem is simply about fitting a function - albeit often a very complex and non-linear one - to from the data (ie the pixels of the image) to a label.  What if we don't attach any 'answers' to our data though? We might want our algorithm to find its own useful categories. K-Means is an algorithm that allows you to do just that.    

### Want even more? 

K-Means is actually a simplified version of another algorithm known as Gaussian Mixture Modeling. With K-Meansyou are essentially assuming that all the clusters are circular.  With Gaussian Mixture Models you can allow clusters to have eliptical shapes instead, which can be more general and powerful for certain problems.  It comes with its own set of problems though, so beware!  I plan to have another project on this at some point in the near future.
