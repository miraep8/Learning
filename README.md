# Project Blog
*last updated 29-Aug-2019*

### Overview:

This is a collection of small projects and useful literature for various cs and math concepts I want to get better at!

My plan is to update this about once a week, and make sure to document very clearly every thing that I include here.  Projects and Literature can sort of blend together at times, so they are just mixed together here.  Each seperate project has its own folder.  Click on that to get more details about that project.

This was created mostly for me to practice these skills on a regular basis, and to practice explaining them well, but I do hope someone else finds them useful too!

### Organization:

Each project or idea has its own folder above.  To explore, open the folder.  The README.md for each of these projects tries to motivate why this idea is interesting or useful (it will just appear at the bottom of the page under all the contents of the folder).  To get a better understanding of how the algorithm actually works open the Interactive Notebook which is also in the folder.  This will step you through the algorithm with examples along the way. 

Lastly each folder should also have a script you can download which implements the algorithm.  Sometimes there will also be accompanying graphical components which will further allow you to play around with the data/algorithm.
