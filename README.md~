# Project Blog
This is a collection of small projects and useful literature for various cs and math concepts I want to get better at!

My plan is to update this about once a week, and make sure to document very clearly every thing that I include here.  Projects and Literature can sort of blend together at times, so they are just mixed together here.  Each seperate project has its own folder.  Click on that to get more details about that project.

This was created mostly for me to practice these skills on a regular basis, and to practice exaplaining them well, but I do hope someone else finds them useful too!
